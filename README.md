### Flow Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Flow Sensor project employs an Arduino Nano to read and monitor the output of a flow sensor. This project is particularly useful in applications where the measurement and control of fluid flow rates are critical, such as in irrigation systems, water monitoring systems, or industrial processes.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Flow Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram



#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Flow Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the output pin of the flow sensor to an analog input pin (e.g., A0) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the power and ground pins of the flow sensor to the appropriate power and ground pins on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the flow sensor to the Arduino Nano according to the circuit setup.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - After uploading the code, open the serial monitor.
   - Observe the flow sensor values displayed on the serial monitor as fluid flows through the sensor.

#### Applications

- **Fluid Flow Measurement:** Monitor the flow rate of liquids or gases in various systems.
- **Irrigation Systems:** Control water flow in agricultural irrigation systems for efficient water usage.
- **Industrial Processes:** Monitor and regulate fluid flow in industrial processes for optimal performance and safety.

#### Notes

- Ensure correct wiring and connection between the flow sensor and the Arduino Nano.
- Calibrate the sensor if necessary to adjust for different flow rates or sensitivities.
- Experiment with different delay values in the code to optimize the monitoring frequency or responsiveness.
